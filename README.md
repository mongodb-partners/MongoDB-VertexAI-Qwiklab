# Leafy Restaurant

This repository equips you to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that leverages MongoDB Atlas for data storage and Vertex AI's powerful gemini-pro for large language model processing. The core functionality resides in app.py, which utilizes Streamlit for a user-friendly interface and Langchain to seamlessly integrate all components. We'll delve into a practical use case where customers can interact with a restaurant chatbot powered by this RAG model.

## setup

### Install the pre-requisites
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 --version
```
### Run the application
```
cd MongoDB-VertexAI-Qwiklab
streamlit run app.py
```
